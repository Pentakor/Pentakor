### ðŸ‘‹ Hello World!

I'm David Weiss,
I am BSc Computer Science student at the Academic College of Tel Aviv-Yaffo.
This GitHub account serves as a platform for my academic practices and various side projects.
I'm eager to collaborate with other members of the GitHub community and contribute to the world of open source!


Feel free to reach out for collaborations or just to say hello! Let's code and learn together. ðŸ˜ŠðŸš€
